# Read a campaign before it runs and report what would waste a machine or a budget.
#
# Everything a campaign does is decided by a handful of small files, so this is one
# request rather than an agent: it is handed those files and answers from them. Run it
# when the campaign is filled in and before the first job, while changing task.py is
# still free.
#
# Usage: ./review_campaign.sh <campaign> [--model NAME]
#
# The review is written to campaigns/<campaign>/EFFICIENCY-REVIEW.md as well as printed,
# so what was raised before the first job can be checked against what was changed.
#
# The reviewing model is the critic's if one is configured (CRITIC_MODEL and its
# gateway, see docs/settings.md), otherwise the agent's own. Neither is required: with
# no gateway it goes to whatever ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL serves.

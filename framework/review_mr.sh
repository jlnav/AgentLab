# Ask a second model to review a merge request against the evidence behind it, and post
# what it says as a note on the MR.
#
# The reviewer is deliberately not the agent that wrote the change, and deliberately not
# the same model: it is shown the diff and the recorded results, and nothing else, so its
# opinion rests on what a reader of the MR could check.
#
# Usage: ./review_mr.sh <repo-dir> <mr-number> [evidence-file ...]
#
# Env:
#   REVIEW_BASE_URL   proxy speaking the Messages API   (default http://0.0.0.0:4000)
#   REVIEW_MODEL      model name the proxy serves       (default gpt-argo)
#   REVIEW_API_KEY    credential passed upstream        (default $USER)
#   REVIEW_POST       false to print the review instead of posting it
#
# The note names the model that wrote it. The proxy knows which model an alias resolves
# to, so ask it rather than making the reader look up what "gpt-argo" was that week.
